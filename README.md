Gridless -- A boilerplate for responsive, cross-browser websites
================================================================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Gridless is an opinionated HTML5 and CSS3 boilerplate for making [mobile first](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933) [responsive](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design) , cross-browser and websites with [beautiful typography](http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/100e2r/).

Gridless encourages and uses [progressive enhancement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Enhancement) through [mobile first](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933) responsive web design.

**Gridless is meant to be a starting point, which should be edited, tweaked and overwritten to suit each project's design requirements**, rather than being blindly used as a black box of non-touchiness.


PHILOSOPHY
----------

Some of the core principles of Gridless:

### DBY (Don't Bore Yourself) approach

Gridless takes the boring parts of making websites and webapps out. It comes packed with everything you're tired of doing in every new project: [CSS normalization](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/), [beautiful typography](http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/100e2r/), a well-organized folder structure, [IE bugfixes](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/safe-css-hacks) and other nice tricks.

### Progressive responsiveness

Gridless uses [mobile first](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933) [responsive web design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design) to adapt itself to the device's width. This means it'll work anywhere: old feature phones, newer smartphones, tablets, notebooks and bigger desktops. IE6/7/8 don't support media queries, so we use [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/) to polyfill that.

### Agnostic starting point

Gridless is extremely simple and straightforward. It doesn't come with any predefined grid systems or non-semantic classes. Gridless is meant to be a starting point, which should be edited, tweaked and overwritten to suit each project's design requirements.

---------------

Gridless was tested in the following browsers:

MAKE IT BETTER
--------------

Some tips to improve Gridless *and* your productivity:

- Use a command line tool like [Juicer](https://github.com/cjohansen/juicer) to help you ship code for production and achieve better performance.

- Use [HTML5 polyfills](http://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills) to bring future to all browsers.

- Use a tool like [resizeMyBrowser](http://resizemybrowser.com/) or [ProtoFluid](http://protofluid.com/) for testing your responsive designs on common browser widths.

- Consider using [CSS3 Please!](http://css3please.com/) and [CSSPrefixer](http://cssprefixer.appspot.com/) to help you write faster CSS3.

- Use a script loader like [yepnope.js](http://yepnopejs.com/) or [HeadJS](http://headjs.com/) to load your scripts faster and without blocking.

- [Use more `meta` tags inside your `head`](http://gist.github.com/581868).

- Write [efficient CSS](http://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/) for better browser performance.

- Use an [HTML5 lint tool](http://lint.brihten.com/) for better markup.

- Use [microdata](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#microdata) for better search results and semantic markup.

- If you'd like to use font-sizes outside the default modular scale (1.625), see http://drewish.com/tools/vertical-rhythm and http://modularscale.com.

- If you'd like help people move off IE6 with an warning, add this HTML to your body:

```
<!--[if lt IE 7]>
<div style=' clear: both; height: 59px; padding:0 0 0 15px; position: relative;'>
	<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home?ocid=ie6_countdown_bannercode"><img src="http://www.theie6countdown.com/images/banners/warning_bar_0000_us.jpg" border="0" height="42" width="820" alt="You are using an outdated browser. For a faster, safer browsing experience, upgrade for free today." /></a>
</div>
<![endif]-->
```

FAQ
---

### WHY THE NAME GRIDLESS?

Because Gridless is ...well, gridless. It doesn't come with any grid systems.

In my opinion, grid systems are a great idea, but ***not*** in the way they're being used today â€” with **lots** of presentational classes like `span-x` or `grid_y` in the markup. These classes only describe the presentation of the content, nothing else. Markup should be semantic; it is meant to describe the **structure** of the content.

Grid systems can be used, but they should be:

- Used with CSS preprocessors like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)/[Compass](http://compass-style.org), [LESS](http://lesscss.org), [PCSS](http://pcss.wiq.com.br/) etc.

- Edited (modify the `class`es and `id`s) to suit each project's semantics

- Made from the start of each project

Still, if you don't agree with that, just include your favorite grid system (only the grid part, remove the reset, typography etc.) and it'll work like a charm!
